- SPF 30+ (daily) | SPF 50+ (intense sun)
- Mineral-based (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) — best for sensitive or cancer-prone skin
- Fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, hypoallergenic
- Water-resistant — optional but good for long wear

Application Frequency

- Every morning — regardless of weather or indoor/outdoor status
- Reapply every 2 hours — if outdoors or exposed to sunlight
- Reapply after sweating, swimming, or wiping face

Amount

- Face — ~1/4 teaspoon (nickel-sized)
- Full body — ~1 ounce (shot glass)

Application Technique

- Apply on clean, dry skin
- Use light pressure, gentle circular motion
- Cover all exposed areas — ears, neck, eyelids, around nostrils, hairline
- Wait 15 mins before sun exposure

Circumstances to Apply

- Sunny days — essential
- Cloudy days — still up to 80% UV exposure
- Indoors near windows — UVA penetrates glass
- Driving — window-side sun exposure
- Snow, sand, water environments — reflect UV, higher exposure
- High altitudes — stronger UV

Extras

- Avoid expired sunscreen
- Check labels yearly — replace if separated, smells off, or expired
- Pair with physical protection — hats, sunglasses, clothing
- Don’t rely on makeup SPF alone
