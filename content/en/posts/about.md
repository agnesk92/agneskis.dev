✨ Building gives me joy. ✨

Let it be software, knitting, clay, woodwork, knowledge.
Seeing progress and increasing perfection makes me happy.

### Other than that

🐕 I am a dog owner.

📚 I am a reader.

🏃🏻‍♀️ I am a runner.

👩🏻‍🌾 I am a gardener.

🧩 I am all about the details and precision.

🧠 I am a psychology nerd.

♥️ And will always be a mathematician at heart.

### My engineering code of conduct

👍🏻 Leave services as you would want to find them:

- easy to read, use or reuse
- tested and testable
- with informative but brief documentation (if people will not spend time reading it, it is only misleading)

✨ Be reasonable, not fancy

🔧 Systematic solutions work best

🤝 Collaboration makes a performant team, not 10x engineers, so be nice and share authority and responsibility
