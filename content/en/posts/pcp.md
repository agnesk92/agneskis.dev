title: 🤝 Personal Coding Principles
---

#### 👍🏻 Leave services as you would want to find them

- easy to read, use, or reuse
- tested and testable
- with informative but brief documentation (if it is hard to read, it will turn into clutter)

#### ✨ Be reasonable, not fancy

#### 🔧 Systematic solutions work best

#### 🤝 Collaboration creates a high-performing team, not just 10x engineers, so

- be kind
- share authority & responsibility
