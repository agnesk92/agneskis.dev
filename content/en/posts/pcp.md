### Principles 🌈

#### Leave services as you would want to find them 👍🏻

- easy to read, use, or reuse (aim at making Lego pieces)
- tested and testable
- with informative & brief documentation

#### Be reasonable, not fancy ✨

Most companies shouldn't allow wasting their time and resources.
Use tools that provide the best fit to your product and not the ones that you are keen on trying.

#### Systematic solutions work best 🔧

Never blame the person, blame the system that allowed the mistake to happen.
People come and go, but culture lingers.

#### Collaboration for productivity 🤝

Not individual geniuses, but good teams are the source of sustainable productivity.

- so be kind
- share authority & responsibility (and don't forget about credit)

#### We are people 🌈

- DevX matters
- Every problem is people problem (most often it is not about capability, but diversity)

### Sources 📚

Some of the books & sources that contributed most to what I think of being an engineer

[Accelerate](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35747076-accelerate) by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim.

[Tidy first?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218715649-tidy-first) by Kent Back.

From these books I learnt much about good collaboration and effective ways of working.

Accelerate backs things by data, and groups them so you can almost use the book as a day-to-day guide on anything about performant engineering.

Tidy first is a simple and very logical set of rules to speed up the often frustration-filled process of code reviews.

[Surviving academia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225242569-surviving-academia---studies-on-the-sustainability-of-science-and-academ) by my dear sister, Andrea Kis.

Her dissertation taught me some important things about people, culture, and diversity.

Most importantly, that you should not just define your culture well, but measure it too - something that companies most often fail to do.
